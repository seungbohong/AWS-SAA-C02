- on-premises app
- Microsoft SQL server DB
- alternate db
- every 4hours does a full copy



The answer is B

1. Question itself states " What should a solution architect recommend as replacement database?" 
2. " users experience latency" when backup is taken from SQL Server. This means an alternate DB needs to be considered. Migrating to Aurora will eliminate this latency. For SQL Server, I/O activity is suspended briefly during backup - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CreateSnapshot.html 
3. Elasticity, availability, replicas - everything is provided by Aurora

- chat app with DynamoDB(NoSQL)
- new messages to be read as little latency
- minimal app changes



A is correct.

DAX provides increased throughput and potentail operational cost savings by reducing the needs to overprovision read capacity units.

DAX does all the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables without requiring developers to manage cache invalidation, data polulateion or cluster management.

DynamoDB is serverless so why care about provisioning read capacities?

Moreover DAX always refer back to the DynamoDB and still provide response blazingly fast for new reads. REMEMBER DAX is a write-through cache. Don't compare it with other in-cache services.

- at least 10TB of storage with maximum I/O performance for video processing
- 300TB of very durable storage for storing media content
- 900TB of storage to meet requirements for archival media that is not in use anymore
- What is recommended?

Maximum I/O performance ==> instance store

Very durable storage ==> S3

archival data ==> S3 Glacier

The answer is D

I/O is preferred than temporary storage.

- S3 as its object storage solution
- thousands of S3 buckets it uses to store data
- less frequently than others
- lifecycle policies are not consistently implemented or are implemented partially
- resulting high-cost storage



C is correct

S3 intelligent-Tiering for data with unknown or changing access pattern.

It is a new Amazon S3 storage class designed for customers who want to optimize storage costs automatically when data access patterns change, without performance impact or operational overhead.

It also says that "lifecycle policies are not consistently implemented or are implemented partially, resulting in data being stored high-cost storage"
